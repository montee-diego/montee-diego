![Front-end Developer](/img/front-end_developer.svg)

I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a background in application integration and support. All
my projects are designed and built from scratch with one or more of the following objectives:

- Solve a problem
- Learn something new
- Have fun

My goal is to write code that is easy to read and explains itself while maintaining an organized
project structure. Also, DRY is king and I try my best to avoid repetition.

Every project in my account has a detailed README with all the information related to it, so do not
forget to check it out!
